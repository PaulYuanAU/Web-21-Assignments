1. The diff output shows the differences between two files, first.md and second.md. The lines that start with a minus sign (-) are lines that are present in first.md but have been removed or changed in second.md. Lines that start with a plus sign (+) are lines that have been added or changed in second.md.
According to the diff output:
A line containing the letter D has been removed (as indicated by -D).
New lines containing +$, +#, and +% have been added.
Therefore, the content of second.md should be:
A
B
\$
C
\#
\%
E
F

2. True. git reset can indeed be used to unstage a file that has been added to the staging area with git add. When you run a command like git reset <file>, it will remove the file from the staging area but leave the changes in your working directory.

3. False. git reset can be used to undo commits in a Git repository by moving the HEAD and current branch pointer to a specified commit, effectively making the repository forget any commits that came after the one you reset to. git revert, on the other hand, creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by one or more existing commits. It does not remove the commits themselves, which maintains the history.

4. True. git checkout <commit> can be used to view the state of the repository at the point of a specific commit. This command is often used to switch between branches or to check out commits from the history.

5. True. You cannot commit changes directly from the working directory to the repository. You must first stage the changes with git add, which adds them to the staging area, before you can commit them to the repository with git commit.

6. False. git log -p shows the commit log with the patch output (showing the changes introduced by each commit), while git log without any options just shows the commit messages. They do not give the same output.

7. False. git log --oneline shows a brief summary of each commit, with just the commit ID and the title of the commit message. git log --stat shows the commit message along with some statistics about what changed in each commit (like how many lines were added or removed). They provide different levels of detail.

8. True. git revert is generally safer because it doesn't alter the existing commit history. Instead, it adds a new commit that reverses the changes made by previous commits. git reset, especially when used with --hard, can permanently remove changes from the commit history, which might be undesirable if you want to preserve the integrity of the historical record.
